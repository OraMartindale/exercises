# Progress Steps with React Implementation

This project takes the tutorial taught in [Day 2 of 50 Projects in 50 Days](https://udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23595208) and replaces the Javascript implementation with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
